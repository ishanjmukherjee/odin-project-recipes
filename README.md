The [recipes project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) in vanilla HTML from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

Some nifty details:

- Resizing text to look good as an image caption on the home and laung lata pages. Implemented using the `<small>` tag. 
- Embedded YouTube video on the peach cobbler page. Implemented using the `<iframe>` tag. 
- Blockquoting on the peach cobbler page. Implemented using the `<blockquote>` tag.
- Jump links at the bottom of the laung lata and peach cobbler pages. Implemented using `id` attribute and `<a href="#ID">` tags.
