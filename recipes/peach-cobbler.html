        <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/4445-best-peach-cobbler" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NYT Cooking</a> with some style notes:
    </p>
    <p>
        <blockquote>
            This recipe is all about showcasing the fruit, so when you transfer the batter to the pan, it will not completely cover the bottom, nor will it cover the top of the peaches. As it bakes, the batter will rise up along the sides of the pan and through the peaches, developing a crisp exterior and tender interior. If you'd like a taller cobbler with a higher cake-to-fruit ratio, do as many readers do, and double the batter.
        </blockquote>
