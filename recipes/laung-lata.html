    <!-- Description -->

    <h2>Crispy outside, juicy inside</h2>
    <p><a href="https://tourism.bihar.gov.in/en/experiences/food/sweet/laung-lata" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bihar Tourism</a> puts it well:</p>

        <blockquote>
            The outer layer is made using all-purpose flour and it is filled with a mix of milk mava and nuts. The outer layer is sealed using lavang (clove) which gives an exotic aroma to it. When served warm it tastes awesome. The richness of mava, nuts, and ghee gives a delicious taste. â€¦

        <blockquote>
            The <abbr title="An aromatic spice native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia">clove</abbr> of this crusty crunchy dessert sets it apart from others. As soon as you keep it in your mouth, the strong taste of clove will melt in the whole mouth with a sweetness flavor.
